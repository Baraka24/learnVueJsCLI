# learnVueJsCLI
The Vue CLI comes with a built-in development server. This allows you to run your app locally so you can test it easily without needing to configure a server yourself. The CLI adds a serve command to the project's package.json file as an npm script, so you can easily run it.
So amazing to learn Vue from
